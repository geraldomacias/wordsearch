** Running the project **

1. Compile wordsearch.java using the command:
    javac wordsearch.javac
2. Before running the program, have a CSV file containing individual letters
  in a rectangle format. Ex:
  a,b,c,d
  e,f,g,h
  i,j,k,l
3. Start the program using the command, followed by the filename and location
  of the CSV file. Ex:
    java wordsearch simpsons.csv
4. The program will request the input of a string, which the program will search
  for. An appropriate prompt will be displayed wether the given word was found or
  not. Type 0 to terminate program.

NOTE: The current project is in progress and can only search to the right.
TODO: Search left, up, down, and diagonal directions.
